## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines whether an employee within a large multinational corporation (MNC) should receive a promotion to a managerial position or below. The client operates across 15 broad verticals and faces challenges in identifying the most suitable candidates for promotion in a timely manner.

Currently, the promotion process involves:

Identifying a set of employees based on recommendations and past performance.
Enrolling selected employees in specialized training and evaluation programs tailored to each vertical's required skills.
Evaluating employees at the end of these programs, using various factors, including training performance, to decide on promotions.
This project aims to streamline the promotion identification process by leveraging data-driven insights, ensuring that the right candidates are recognized and prepared for advancement efficiently.
